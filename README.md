# Midterm Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This repository contains my midterm projects for machine learning and deep learning tasks as part of the academic coursework. It includes exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, clustering, and transaction fraud detection techniques using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Repository Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `midterm_regresi.ipynb` | Regression analysis and modeling on dataset(s) |
| `clustering_midterm.ipynb` | Clustering techniques applied to group similar data |
| `midterm_transaction_data.ipynb` | Analysis and classification of transaction data for fraud detection |

## Overview

This repo is part of a midterm assignment covering practical implementation of foundational machine learning and deep learning concepts using real or sample datasets. The notebooks demonstrate:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Feature analysis and visualization  
- Regression models for prediction  
- Clustering algorithms for unsupervised learning  
- Anomaly detection and classification for transactions
